# OpenCode-Inductions
My projects for **OpenCode NITR Inductions**:
I've recently learnt Python although I have had some experience in C/C++ earlier; so I thought why not give my project a try with Python. So, I've basically uploaded 2 projects; A **"Caesar Cipher"** program and a **"Black Jack"** game respectively.


The North American game of **Blackjack**, also known as 21, has been one of the most popular casino games of the last hundred years and has spread throughout the world. In the 21st century it has been overtaken in popularity by Slots (slot machine games), but it remains one of the most popular casino card games and is available in almost all casinos both on and offline.

To play a hand of Blackjack the following steps must be followed:

1.Create a deck of 52 cards;

2.Shuffle the deck;

3.Ask the Player for their bet;


4.Make sure that the Player's bet does not exceed their available chips;

5.Deal two cards to the Dealer and two cards to the Player;

6.Show only one of the Dealer's cards, the other remains hidden;

7.Show both of the Player's cards;

8.Ask the Player if they wish to Hit, and take another card;

9.If the Player's hand doesn't Bust (go over 21), ask if they'd like to Hit again.

10.If a Player Stands, play the Dealer's hand. The dealer will always Hit until the Dealer's value meets or exceeds 17;

11.Determine the winner and adjust the Player's chips accordingly;

12.Ask the Player if they'd like to play again;

 As for the **Caeser Cipher**, we need to implement Caesr cipher, both encoding and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC". This simple "monoalphabetic substitution cipher" provides almost no security, because an attacker who has the encoded message can either use frequency analysis to guess the key, or just try all 25 keys
